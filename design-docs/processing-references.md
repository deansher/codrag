Cora uses a **version-aware** approach for your **ContentEntityDefinition** vs. **ContentEntityReference** classes, along with guidance on how to handle reference resolution at query time. This design separates what each side actually *knows*—the defining side has details like `lineStart` or chunk references, while the referencing side only knows “I’m using identifier X, from some external entity.”

---

# 1. Key Principles

1. **Per-Version Objects**  
   - Every time a file changes (and thus a new `FileVersion` is produced), new `ContentEntityDefinition` objects are created for any definitions in that file.  
   - Similarly, new `ContentEntityReference` objects are created for references in that new version of the file.  
   - This ensures your schema captures how definitions and references evolve over time, without conflating older versions.

2. **Minimal Cross-Knowledge**  
   - `ContentEntityDefinition` is an authoritative record of “where and how this identifier is defined,” including line numbers, chunk references, etc.  
   - `ContentEntityReference` only stores the *usage* side. It doesn’t store or repeat definition details.  
   - Reference resolution is done at query time by matching the reference’s `identifierUsed` (plus any other needed metadata) against candidate definitions in the appropriate version(s).

3. **Query-Time Resolution**  
   - When you want to see “which definition does reference R point to?” you perform a query that looks for definitions with a matching `identifier`, appropriate `entityType`, possibly matching module paths, and a compatible version or prior version.  
   - You can also do the reverse: “which references point to definition D?” by matching reference fields (identifier, version constraints, etc.).

# 2. Proposed Schema

## 2.1. **ContentEntityDefinition**  

Represents the authoritative definition of a named code or documentation entity **in one specific file version**.  
```ts
const contentEntityDefinitionSchema = {
  class: 'ContentEntityDefinition',
  properties: [
    {
      name: 'identifier',
      dataType: ['text'],
      description: 'The name or heading of this entity (function name, class name, doc section, etc.)',
      indexFilterable: true,
      indexSearchable: true,
    },
    {
      name: 'entityType',
      dataType: ['text'],
      description: 'High-level type: function, class, markdownSection, etc.',
      indexFilterable: true,
      indexSearchable: true,
    },
    {
      name: 'fileVersion',
      dataType: ['FileVersion'],
      description: 'Reference to the specific FileVersion in which this definition appears',
    },

    // The defining side knows lines and file path
    {
      name: 'filePath',
      dataType: ['text'],
      description: 'The file path for this definition, typically redundant with fileVersion but convenient.',
      indexFilterable: true,
      indexSearchable: true,
    },
    {
      name: 'lineStart',
      dataType: ['int'],
      description: 'Line number where the definition starts',
      indexFilterable: true,
    },
    {
      name: 'lineEnd',
      dataType: ['int'],
      description: 'Line number where the definition ends',
      indexFilterable: true,
    },
    {
      name: 'definedInChunk',
      dataType: ['Chunk'],
      description: 'Optional reference to the chunk that physically contains the definition',
    },

    // Additional optional metadata
    // e.g., "modulePath", "namespace", "visibility" (public/private), "language", etc.
  ],
};
```

### How It Works

- When you parse a file to produce a new `FileVersion`, you identify all definitions in that file.  
- For each definition, you create a new `ContentEntityDefinition`.  
- This newly created record is tied to the file version via `fileVersion = [FileVersion]`.  
- If the file is modified again, the next pass produces new `ContentEntityDefinition` objects with new line ranges or changes as needed.

## 2.2. **ContentEntityReference**

Represents the usage or “mention” of some identifier (e.g., a function call, import, or doc link) **in one specific file version**.  

```ts
const contentEntityReferenceSchema = {
  class: 'ContentEntityReference',
  properties: [
    {
      name: 'identifierUsed',
      dataType: ['text'],
      description: 'The literal name or heading used in the referencing code or doc. E.g., "fooMethod".',
      indexFilterable: true,
      indexSearchable: true,
    },
    {
      name: 'referenceType',
      dataType: ['text'],
      description: 'call, import, link, reexport, mention, etc.',
      indexFilterable: true,
      indexSearchable: true,
    },
    {
      name: 'fileVersion',
      dataType: ['FileVersion'],
      description: 'The version of the file in which this reference occurs',
    },

    // The referencing side knows only its own location
    {
      name: 'filePath',
      dataType: ['text'],
      description: 'The referencing file path (optional if implied by fileVersion)',
      indexFilterable: true,
      indexSearchable: true,
    },
    {
      name: 'lineStart',
      dataType: ['int'],
      description: 'Line where this reference is used',
      indexFilterable: true,
    },
    {
      name: 'lineEnd',
      dataType: ['int'],
      description: 'Line range end for the usage',
      indexFilterable: true,
    },
    {
      name: 'appearsInChunk',
      dataType: ['Chunk'],
      description: 'Reference to the chunk containing this usage, if you want chunk-level linking',
    },

    // Other optional fields
    // e.g. "importPath" for an import statement, or "hyperlink" for doc references
  ],
};
```

### How It Works

- When you parse a file in the `FileVersion` stage, you discover references to external identifiers.  
- For each usage, you create a `ContentEntityReference`.  
- This record is tied to the referencing file version via `fileVersion = [FileVersion]`.  
- **It does not** store direct knowledge of the *definition’s* file path or lines. That data belongs to the definition side.

# 3. Query-Time Reference Resolution

Because each reference is just “identifierUsed,” at query time you can resolve references to definitions. For example:

1. **Find possible definitions**:  
   ```graphql
   # Pseudo-GraphQL:
   {
     Get {
       ContentEntityDefinition(where: {
         operator: Equal,
         path: ["identifier"],
         valueText: "identifierUsed"
       }) {
         identifier
         fileVersion { ... }
         lineStart
         ...
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   - You can further filter by `entityType`, `repoId`, or the relevant version constraints.

2. **Apply version logic**  
   - If the referencing file is from commit A, you might prefer definitions that existed on or before commit A. For cross-repo references, you might do multi-step logic or store the commit or branch constraints you care about.

3. **Multi-hop or reexports**  
   - If you also track reexports or aliased references, you might do additional expansions. For example, if “Foo” is reexported as “Bar,” your logic might find the original definition behind “Bar.”

4. **Heuristics or additional matching**  
   - You can match on `identifierUsed` plus `importPath` or `module` fields. If multiple definitions match, rank them by recency or branch.  

---

# 4. Handling Reimports & Aliases

If a referencing file reexports or renames something, your parser can produce:

- **One `ContentEntityReference`** with `identifierUsed = "MyAliasedName"`, `referenceType = "reexport"`, plus an `importPath` that points to the original name.  
- You do additional logic at query time to see whether that path leads to an underlying definition “MyOriginalName.”  

Or, if you prefer to store partial resolution:

- You could insert a temporary property like `possibleDefinitions` (array of `ContentEntityDefinition`) that the parser populates, but that can bloat your data if you do it for every reference. Doing it on demand at query time is often more flexible.

---

# 5. Versioning Tips

1. **Matching Versions**  
   - If the referencing file is from `commitHash = 123`, you might want definitions that also exist in commits up to `123`. But for cross-repo references, you need logic to decide how you map commits or tags between two different repos.  
2. **Storing commit info**  
   - You can keep references to `CommitFileVersion` or store `timestamp` if you want more granular time-based queries.  
3. **Diffing Over Time**  
   - If a definition or reference no longer exists in the newest version, you still have a historical record of it in older versions. That’s okay—it’s just how your knowledge graph evolves.

---

# 6. Practical Usage Example

### 6.1. Indexing / Ingestion

1. **File A** changes -> new `FileVersion A1`.  
   - Found 2 definitions: `MyClass`, `helperFunction`. You create two `ContentEntityDefinition` objects referencing `FileVersion A1`.  
   - Found 3 references calling `helperFunction`, plus 1 import reference -> create 4 `ContentEntityReference` objects referencing `FileVersion A1`.  
2. **File B** changes -> new `FileVersion B1`.  
   - Found a reference to `MyClass` -> create a `ContentEntityReference` object referencing `FileVersion B1`, `identifierUsed="MyClass"`.

### 6.2. Query: “Which definitions does `FileVersion B1` reference?”

1. You query the references in `B1`:  
   - `identifierUsed="MyClass"`, etc.  
2. You search for `ContentEntityDefinition(identifier="MyClass")` in relevant commits or repos.  
   - Possibly you find `MyClass` in `FileVersion A1`.  
3. You can retrieve line info, chunk info from that definition if you want to display it or incorporate it in a RAG snippet.

---

# 7. Advantages of This Approach

- **Distinct Per-Version Entities**: You never mix up definitions from an older commit with references from a newer commit.  
- **Encapsulation**: Each side only stores the info it *actually* has. The referencing side doesn’t know or care about line numbers in the definition file.  
- **Query-Time Flexibility**: As your logic for matching references to definitions evolves, you can improve the resolution process without needing to rewrite stored references.  
- **Scales to Non-Code**: Exactly the same approach for doc headings, config sections, or other content.

**8. Comparison with Leading IDE Approaches**

Most top-tier IDEs (e.g., Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) and language servers (e.g., the Language Server Protocol implementations for TypeScript, Python, Java, etc.) maintain a **live in-memory model** of the user’s current project. They parse and index the code to build **symbol tables** and **reference maps** on the fly. Below is a comparison of how our approach differs and why it may be more suitable for a multi-version or cross-repo scenario:

1. **Scope & Persistence**  
   - **IDE/Language Server**: Typically works on a **single local checkout** at a time, caching symbols and references in memory for the current state of your workspace. Historical versions aren’t tracked unless manually checked out.  
   - **Our Approach**: We explicitly store references and definitions **per-version** of each file in a persistent database (Weaviate). This accommodates multiple repositories, different commits, and historical states in parallel without overwriting or losing prior references. Most importantly for our immediate needs, it minimizes expensive and relatively slow reindexing operations in situations such as the user checking out a different version of a repo. Equally important for the long run, it let's us support RAG across multiple repos -- even very large numbers of repos -- having multiple relevant versions.

2. **Version Awareness**  
   - **IDE/Language Server**: Constantly updates to the newest local state. Past file states are not maintained once changes occur (except in ephemeral undo buffers or source control integrations).  
   - **Our Approach**: Each commit or file change produces new definitions/references, all of which remain queryable. This supports retrospective analyses, blame queries, or comparisons across branches and commits.

3. **Cross-Repo Linking**  
   - **IDE/Language Server**: Typically scans a single project or workspace at a time. Cross-project references (like a library from a different repo) often require separate indexing or library metadata.  
   - **Our Approach**: We can ingest multiple repos, each with multiple branches/commits, and unify references into a central knowledge graph. Query-time reference resolution can find matches across any repository version, enabling deeper multi-repo code intelligence.

4. **Reference Resolution Timing**  
   - **IDE/Language Server**: Resolves references immediately while you type, updating symbol tables on every edit. When you “go to definition,” it uses its in-memory graph.  
   - **Our Approach**: Defers resolution to query time, matching references against definitions in the data store. This is more flexible for large-scale or historical queries but means references must be calculated on demand rather than always stored in a fully-resolved state.

5. **Data Model Complexity**  
   - **IDE/Language Server**: Maintains a sophisticated, language-specific AST plus a symbol table in memory. It can handle advanced language features (like templates, generics, macros). However, these details are typically ephemeral.  
   - **Our Approach**: Stores definitions and references in a generic, versioned schema. While less language-specific at ingestion time, it provides a **persistent knowledge graph**. Depth of language-specific features (like macro expansion) can be added over time or during extended indexing.

6. **Historical & Analytical Queries**  
   - **IDE/Language Server**: Typically optimizes for immediate interactive usage (intellisense, refactoring, debug). Historical or multi-branch queries are out of scope unless integrated with version control plugins.  
   - **Our Approach**: Designed for **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**, knowledge discovery, and analytics over an entire codebase’s history. It can track references across commits and branches, supporting advanced queries (e.g., “When was function X introduced? How has it changed over time?”).

7. **Multi-User & Shared Environment**  
   - **IDE/Language Server**: Usually local to a single developer’s environment. Shared usage across a large team requires specialized services (like GitHub Codespaces or JetBrains Projector) but is still ephemeral per workspace.  
   - **Our Approach**: Centralizes indexing and reference data in a server-based store. Multiple team members or automation systems can query the same knowledge graph simultaneously, each referencing the commits or branches they care about.

In summary, **IDE approaches** optimize for **real-time language intelligence** in a single workspace, while **our approach** leverages a persistent, version-aware knowledge graph suitable for cross-repo, cross-version queries and historical analysis.
